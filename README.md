# Physics Calculator

### I followed a tutorial forked from another repo on github. Planning to rework and add sin(), cos(), tan() functionality to the calculator. At the moment they produce an error

## How to use:
1. clone the repo
2. search *live server* on extensions in VScode and install
3. after install, right click html > Open with Live Server
